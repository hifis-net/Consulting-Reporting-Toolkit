other_identified_problems:
  - Missing VCS knowledge
  - Poor code structure
  - No Exception handling
  - No logging
remarks: The request initially was to expedite the python code execution time leveraging the full use of all the CPU
  cores in the clients VM-based HPC machine. As part of the consulting, we introduced, previously non-existent version
  control (GitLab) to the client's code and converted the existing Python code of version 2.7 to >3.6. We then cleaned
  up the code with logging and exception handling and finally accelerated the code using the Multiprocessing API from
  Python. Later while deployment, we also fixed some environment issues in the clients HPC system for a smooth run
  of the new code.
